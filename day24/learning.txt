Directory:
    Absolute file path:
        /Work/Project/talk.ppt
    Relative file path:
        File in working directory: ./talk.ppt or talk.ppt
    Working directory: The directory you are currently in.
        File outside working directory: ../report.ppt
        2 files outside working directory: ../../desktop
