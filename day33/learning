API: Application Programming interface
    API request and API endpoint
        Sometimes you could request simple data from an API (like asking the time at a bank),
        but other times I need permission (getting money from the bank).

    JSON
        compressed to not use much data.


Codes:
    1XX: Hold On
    2XX: Here You Go
    3XX: Go Away
    4XX: You Screwed Up
    5XX: Server Screwed Up
    .raise_for_status() tells you the problem.
