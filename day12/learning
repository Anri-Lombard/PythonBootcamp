Global scope:
    Variable declared outside of function and can be used throughout file.
Local scope:
    Variable not declared outside of function and only useful to that particular function.
    To modify global variables I could just
NO block scope in python:
    If variable indented in if or while it is still globally accesable.
Global CONSTANTS:
    Global constants are all UPPER CASE so we can use it as global and not shange it.
